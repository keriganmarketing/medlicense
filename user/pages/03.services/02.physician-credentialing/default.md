<p>Your practice has hired a physician. However the real work has just begun. You now have to Credential the Physician in order to be in compliance with the Joint Commission (formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) accreditation. What do you do? You can assume the task yourself and bog down your credentialing office with hours and hours of requests, emails, phone calls, and research OR you can allow MedLicense.com to handle it for you. Allowing MedLicense.com to credential your Physicians and then maintain their credentialing is a much smarter, efficient decision.</p>
<p>Joint Commission standards require that the verification process of a physician's background retain the integrity of primary source. Primary Source simply means that the required verification was delivered to you directly from the verifying body. Unfortunately the process can be problematic and time consuming.</p>
<p>MedLicense.com offers a clear, efficient solution to Hospitals, Insurers, and Physician Practices. Our specialty is State Medical Board Licensure (The most extreme and problematic type of primary source credentialing that is in existence). Our professional services push the licensure process through to the State Medical Boards in an abbreviated fashion, delivering the issued medical licenses to the Physicians in a time span that meets their needs. These same services and protocols are applied to the Physician Credentialing process to insure an expedited, trouble free credentialing cycle.</p>
