<p>About half of the States are Non-Compact States. As you probably already know, the licensure process with Compact States is simple, direct, and efficient. However, this is not the case with Non-Compact States. Applying to one or two Non-Compact States is a simple process. However, managing the process for 10+ Licensing processes concurrently can be overwhelming and daunting. That is why MedLicense.com is now offering its' Physician Licensing Service to Nurses who desire to practice telemedicine. We can "Project Manage" the process for you so that you can concentrate on helping patients.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cec9tdg20">How does the process work?</h2>
<p>Once our short order form is completed and a copy of each Nurse's CV is provided, MedLicense.com will orginiate a licensure packet for each Nurse / each State. The packet will then be forwarded to the Nurse in question or the enrollment will be arranged by a visit from a MedLicense.com Licensure Professional. The average time for a 15+ State enrollment Packet typically runs 2 hours - including fingerprinting and notarization. Once the licensure packets are completed, the applications will be re-compiled and submitted to each State Nursing Board. After the submission of each application, the verification process begins. MedLicense.com will submit and request the various required primary source verifications and back ground checks. After the request, the process does not stop. MedLicense.com will weekly follow up with each verification and Nursing Board untl the Nursing Board acknowledges that the application is complete and the Nurse License is issued.</p>
<p>Without consistent, continual follow up, the process will stall. MedLicense.com will continualy follow up with each verifying source until the application is complete.</p>
<p>Our service fee for 15+ State Nurse Licenses is $409 per State. For volume greater than 50+ State Nursing Applications, please call to discuss our rate plan.</p>
