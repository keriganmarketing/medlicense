<h2 id="mcetoc_1cdnqc14n3">The History of Telemedicine:</h2>
<p>In 2010, MedLicense.com observed a shift in the type of physicians and practices which sought Telemedicine Licenses. Prior to 2010, the majority of Physicians and Medical Practices which sought Telemedicine Licenses were involved mainly in specialized medicine ( i.e. Radiology, Pathology, Psychiatry, and Neuromonitoring )and Physicians connected with online Pharmacies. However in 2010 and the years that follow, we witnessed a shift towards General Medicine / Family Practice. The advances in technology and changing attitudes toward the delivery of care via the internet have brought forth the reality of true Internet-Based Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, from the comfort of your home, you can search, find, and review potential online practices and physicians. Once your selection is made, through the practices website, you enter your information, schedule an interview with a Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant, or Physician, have a proper prognosis provided, and then visit your pharmacy to pick up the required prescription. For many issues and conditions, having to wait in a Doctor's Office with 20 other sick people, hoping that you do not catch what they have, will become a thing in the past.</p>
<p>The convenience of seeing a physician from your own home will also realize the reduced cost of treatment. The Physician or Practice typically will have less over head.</p>
<p>Because of this the percentage of Telemedicine Licenses to Non-Telemedicine Licenses has drastically increased. Physician's practicing Telemedicine need to protect themselves by obtaining a Full Medical License or Telemedicine License in each State where they will be accepting Telemedicine Patients. The cost is minimal compared with risks associated with not being licensed. MedLicense.com is experienced and capable to handling this scale of licensure.

<h2 id="mcetoc_1cdnqflcq0">Additional Telemedicine License Information:</h2>
<p>Advances in technology have opened new doors of opportunity for many medically underserved communities in America. Licensure laws that regulate interstate telemedicine practice vary from state to state. Restrictive licensure laws require a practitioner to obtain a full license to deliver telemedicine care across state lines. A number of States require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license. If a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. MedLicense.com's Telemedicine License Service can reduce the burden and cost of obtaining the required Telemedicine Licenses. Most States require the Physician to have a license where they are physically located and where the patient resides.</p>
