It is not uncommon for MedLicense.com to provide nationwide Teleradiology License Service to Telemedicine setting up Teleradiology practices to service all 50 States. Unfortunately there is not a National Teleradiology License. Most States require that the physician have a license in each State where the patients/physical care is being given. Some States are now offering special Teleradiology Licenses. Teleradiology is a new field which the Medical Boards are now addressing. This combined with the governmental and legal liability of treating patients whom are not physically present in your State has opened the door for considerable problems if a Board Complaint or Malpractice Suit is filed against the Physician.&nbsp;<br /><br />Physician's practicing Teleradiology need to protect themselves by obtaining a Full Medical License or Teleradiology license in each State where they will be accepting Teleradiology Contracts.

<h2 id="mcetoc_1cdns56dd2">Additional Teleradiology License Service Information:</h2>
<p>Advances in technology have opened new doors of opportunity for many medically underserved communities in America. Licensure laws that regulate interstate Teleradiology practice vary from state to state. Restrictive licensure laws require a practitioner to obtain a full license to deliver Telemedicine care across state lines.&nbsp;<br /><br />A number of States require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license. If a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. MedLicense.com can reduce the burden and cost of obtaining the required licensure. Most States require the Physician to have a license where they are physically located and where the patient resides.</p>
