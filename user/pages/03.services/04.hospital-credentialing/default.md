<p>MedLicense.com can provide complete Hospital Credentialing Services. Unfortunately the Credentialing process does not end with the issuance of a Medical License and DEA Number. If a physician is going to hold hospital privileges or participate in a hospital based practice, then the hospital privileging process has to be undertaken and completed. In many cases, as in the case of Teleradiology and Telemedicine, the physician will have the need to credential in multiple hospitals. The paperwork can be daunting at best. The process is straight forward. Our clients set up their account with our firm by utilizing our secure online form. Once submitted, MedLicense.com will obtain the credentialing documentation from the Hospitals in question or directly from the Physician. MedLicense.com will then set up all the required forms and documents and forward to the Physician for proofing and signatures. Once returned to MedLicense.com, the required application packet will be forwarded to the Medical Staff Office/Credentialing office of each Medical Center in question. MedLicense.com will then request all primary source Applications directly from the required third parties. Follow up with each primary source certification will occur every 2 to 5 business days. All of this for only $429.00 per Hospital. This is a flat rate. No additional charges or fees will be charged by MedLicense.com for the credentialing services. (All fees charged by 3rd parties are the responsibility of the Physician.)</p>
