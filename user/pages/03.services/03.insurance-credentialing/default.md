<p>Unfortunately the credentialing process does not end with the issuance of a Medical License and DEA Number. If a physician or Medical Group is going to accept payment from her/his patients through their insurance policies then that physician will have to be credentialed with each insurance company. The paperwork can be daunting at best. That is why MedLicense.com offers Insurance Credentialing Services. The process is straightforward. Our clients set up their account with our firm by utilizing our secure online form. Once submitted, MedLicense.com will obtain the credentialing documentation from the Insurance Companies in question or directly from the Physician / Medical Group. MedLicense.com will then set up all the required forms and documents and forward to the Physician for proofing and signatures. Once returned to MedLicense.com, the required application packet will be forwarded to the Credentialing office of each Insurance Company in question. MedLicense.com will then request all primary source Applications directly from the required third parties. Follow up with each primary source certification will occur every 2 to 5 business days. All of this for only $359.00 per Insurance Company. This is a flat rate. No additional charges or fees will be charged by MedLicense.com for the credentialing services. (All fees charged by 3rd parties are the responsibility of the Physician.)</p>
