<p>If you have tried to contact the Puerto Rico Medical Board, then you have discovered that just getting someone on the phone is a supernatural event. The Board doesn't answer emails or answer their phone. If you are able to have someone at the Board answer the phone, the chances are that that person cannot help you and that you will be told to call back and speak to another person who can. The Puerto Rico Medical Board does not have a website that works or an online application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the problems with the lack of professionalism and basic customer service with the Puerto Rico Medical Board, MedLicense.com is no longer handling license applications with Puerto Rico. The only way we will handle the process for our clients is if the physician agrees to obtain all updates directly from the Puerto Rico Medical Board.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ce9v6mf90">Additional Puerto Rico Medical Board Licensing Information:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The fee paid to Puerto Rico is $1250.00</li>
<li>You will need two licensed Puerto Rico Physicians to complete the Puerto Rico Medical Board Reference Form. The best source for this requirement typically can be found in the facility/employer in Puerto Rico which is requesting that you apply for a license with the Puerto Rico Medical Board</li>
<li>The process with the Puerto Rico Medical Board typically cycles on a bi-weekly basis. As such updates are going to have an accuracy of 14 days give or take. Updates can only be obtained when we send our staff member to the Board to meet with the Board.</li>
<li>The Puerto Rico Medical Board is very inefficient. As such they lose 20-25% of the mail sent to them. This causes delays. The process grinds slowly with this medical board and as such has to be built into the expected time frame for issuance of the Medical License</li>
<li>The Fee which MedLicense.com charges for Puerto Rico is $1699.00. This is double the fee for the Licensure process for any other Medical Board in the USA. The reason for this is that we have a much higher base line cost to handle the process for Puerto Rico due to the unique requirements of the Puerto Rico Medical Board process.</li>
</ul>
