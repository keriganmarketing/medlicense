<h2 id="mcetoc_1ce9me1q60">Additional Vermont Medical Board Licensing Information:</h2>
<p>Vermont is requires a personal interview. Unlike other State Medical Boards, the interview can be conducted by Video Conference through the Internet. The application with Vermont is exhaustive and can take some time to work through. The Board is not an adverse Medical Board (The MD Board). The Osteopathic Vermont Board is adverse and tends to obsess over non-issues whereas the MD Medical Board does not.</p>
