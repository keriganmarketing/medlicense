<h2 id="mcetoc_1cdq1hcdg0">Additional Arkansas Medical License Service Information:</h2>
<p>Arkansas has made some significant changes since the beginning of 2011. Changes for the better. Most Physicians can be issued without attending a mandatory Meeting. In the past a trip to Little Rock was required. Some verifications can be faxed to the AR Med Board. In the past they had to be mailed. We found the approval process by Arkansas to be arbitrary. Now there seems to be a standardized process by which licenses are issued on the basic educational and training merits of the Physician. Arkansas is no longer the most difficult to apply to. Their process is extensive but not worse than Massachusetts.</p>
