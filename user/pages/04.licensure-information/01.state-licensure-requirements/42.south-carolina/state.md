<h2 id="mcetoc_1ce9kjp2n0">Additional South Carolina Medical Board Information:</h2>
<p>The South Carolina Medical Board has mandated the use of FCVS. This can add some time to the licensure process. South Carolina will not issue the Temporary or Full Medical License until the FCVS packet is received. FCVS will average 2 to 4 months for Domestic Graduates and 3 to 9 months for International Graduates.</p>
<p>The The South Carolina Medical Board also has in place a 10 year rule for Board Certification. If the Physician has not taken a written Board Exam within 10 years of the application, then the SPEX Examination will be required. The Applicant can submit 150 hours of CME's in place of the SPEX and the SPEX will be waived. If the Physician has been Board Certified or Re-certified within 10 years of the application then the SPEX is waived.</p>
