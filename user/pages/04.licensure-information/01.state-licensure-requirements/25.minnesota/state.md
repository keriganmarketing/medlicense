<p>With the Minnesota Medical Board, MedLicense.com is averaging 60 to 120 days for the issuance of a Minnesota Medical License from the submission of the application to the Medical Board to the issuance of the Physician Minnesota Medical License for Domestic Graduates. International Graduates might take longer due to the direct certification of the International Medical School.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Medical Board has a very high certification load which the physician is required to fulfill. Most Medical Boards only verify Education, Examine Scores, Training, and Licensure History. In addition to this, the Minnesota Medical Board verifies Board Certification, 2 Physician References, the AMA Profile, NPDB-HIPDB, and 5 years of Hospital Privilege History. Because of this, the process can run a little longer.There is an interview requirement which is mandatory for the physician to complete before the license will be issued.</p>
<p>Mail loss is a significant issue when applying to the Minnesota Medical Board. Due to the large number of Applications, a portion of the direct source Applications might be lost in transit or at the Medical Board. This will then require that the lost certification be re-requested.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ce98npp90">Additional Minnesota Medical Board Licensing Information:</h2>
<p>Beyond the extensive verification load, the Minnesota Medical Board is one of a few States that has mandated the SPEX Examination if a physician has not passed a written licensure examination or taken a Board Certification (Re-certification) Exam within the past 10 years of the application. If a physician applies for a Minnesota <a href="../../services/telemedicine-licensing">Telemedicine License</a> then the SPEX examination is waived if the Physician is Board Certified.</p>
