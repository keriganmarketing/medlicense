<h2 id="mcetoc_1cec28p230">Additional Arizona Licensing Information:</h2>
<p>The Arizona Osteopathic Medical Board has a streamlined, quick process. The State verifies the NPDB-HIPDB and FSMB Board Action directly. Many verifications can be faxed to the Arizona Osteopathic Medical Board instead of being mailed. This helps expedite the process. It has a low Mail Loss Rate (MLR). Faxes and mail are rarely lost and as such reduces the delays cause by re-requesting required primary source items. The applications typically are approved internally and do not require a meeting to issue the license.</p>
