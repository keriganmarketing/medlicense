<p>The Missouri Medical Board issued our first license to a Physician who took the Puerto Rico Medical Examination. Missouri is the only Medical Board which still sponsors the Puerto Rico Medical Examination. We currently have a number of pending applications in Missouri from our clients based in Puerto Rico. This development will be welcomed news to them as the difficult process of obtaining Puerto Rico based verifications is completed on their behalf.</p>
