<p class="c3">The Illinois Medical Board's licensing process is typical of the process for the majority of other medical boards. The Illinois Medical License process has a few unique requirements which separate this medical board from the others.</p>
<p class="c3">The Illinois Medical Board recently resolved its' budget crisis. They are back in business. However, because of the budget issue, the mail is approximately 4-6 weeks in arrears. This will translate into delays in processing the application and the verifications which will arrive after the application. Licensure time frames can be expected to take 90 to 120 days for most Illinois Medical License applications.</p>
