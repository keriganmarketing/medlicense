<p>Today we were notified that our latest physician applying to the State of Massachusetts was issued his license in just under 40 days. His application was filed with the Massachusetts Medical Board on 06/11/10. We expedited the process and guided our client to a successful completion of one of the most arduous licensure processes in the USA.</p>
