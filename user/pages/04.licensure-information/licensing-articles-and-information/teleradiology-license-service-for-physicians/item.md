<p>Are you prepared to take on the daunting task of multi-state licensing? You probably don't have the time to handle this process yourself. That is why you should consider utilizing a Physician Licensing Company such as MedLicense.com.</p>
<p>Our experience is unmatched in the field of Teleradiology and Telemedicine. Radiologist, Consulting Physicians, and Locum Tenens Specialist have utilized our services to obtain licenses in all 50 States. It is not uncommon for MedLicense.com to provide nationwide Teleradiology License Service to Telemedicine setting up Teleradiology practices to service all 50 States. Unfortunately there is not a National Teleradiology License. Most States require that the physician have a license in each State where the patients/physical care is being given. Some States are now offering special Teleradiology Licenses. Teleradiology is a new field which the Medical Boards are now addressing. This combined with the governmental and legal liability of treating patients whom are not physically present in your State has opened the door for considerable problems if a Board Complaint or Malpractice Suit is filed against the Physician.</p>
<p>Physician's practicing Teleradiology need to protect themselves by obtaining a Full Medical License or Teleradiology license in each State where they will be accepting Teleradiology Contracts. The cost is minimal compared to the risk of not being licensed. MedLicense.com is experienced and capable to handling this scale of licensure. MedLicense.com can make an impossible process manageable and feasible. MedLicense.com is experienced in licensing physicians in multiple States at once. This process presents its' own unique issues which must be properly addressed.

We are experienced with Physicians who have licensed in all 50 States at once. Our certification system allows for the application process to proceed smoothly with each State Medical Board simultaneously.</p>
