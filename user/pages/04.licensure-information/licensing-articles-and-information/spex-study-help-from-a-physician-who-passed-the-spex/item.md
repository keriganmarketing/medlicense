<p>Are you scheduled to take the SPEX Examination and need help studying for it? One of our clients took and passed it recently. He informed us that he used the 1400 page text book by McGraw, Hill, Lang - Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment ( Amazon,.com http://www.amazon.com/CURRENT-Medical-Diagnosis-Treatment-LANGE/dp/0071591249 ) The text book is published on a yearly basis. The SPEX test is 75% Internal/General Medicine with the rest touching on Ob/Gyn, Psychiatry (Drug Treatment), Dermatology, and Surgery. Our client informed us that the SPEX test is almost a carbon copy of the NBME Part 3 Examination.</p>
<p>Another physician who just passed the SPEX with a 91% percentile informed me that He also studied the USMLE Step 3 Algorithms along with studying the book</p>
