<p>We received confirmation this week that a pending license application for one of our Physicians who was applying to the South Carolina Medical Board was issued. His application was filed on September 29th, 2010. He did not have a FCVS Packet in place so this process had to be set up from scratch. All items were confirmed as being delivered to the South Carolina Medical Board, including the FCVS packet, on November 4th, 2010. South Carolina issued his Temporary License and the Physician has scheduled his interview for December in order that the permanent license be issued.</p>
