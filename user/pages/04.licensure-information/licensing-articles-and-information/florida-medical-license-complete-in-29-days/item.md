<p>The last items from Dr. Ixxxxx's Florida application was logged in today by the Florida Medical Board. Her application was submitted on 11/08/2010. The AMA profile, which was lost somewhere between the AMA and the Physician's Analyst at Florida was re-requested 2 weeks ago and arrived today. Her license will be issued some time between Friday to Wednesday next week.</p>
