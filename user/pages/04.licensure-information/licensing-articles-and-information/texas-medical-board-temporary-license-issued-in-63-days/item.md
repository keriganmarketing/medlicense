<p>Today we were notified by one of our clients that his Texas Medical License Application is now complete and he has cleared the 2nd Review. With this his Temporary License has been issued. This type of time frame is obtainable if the physician is willing to submit the Fingerprint Cards and take the Jurisprudence Exam when first notified by the Medical Board that these issues are ready to be submitted. We were able to have his Form L's, NPDB-HIPDB, Examination Scores, and Form I's sent to the Texas Medical Board in an expedited manner. The Screening Dept. of Texas was able to move him to the 2nd Review. The Review found no deficiencies upon reviewing the file. His application will go before the next Board Meeting which is up coming in October.</p>
