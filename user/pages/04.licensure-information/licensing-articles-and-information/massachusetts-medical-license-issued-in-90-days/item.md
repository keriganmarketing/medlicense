<p>We received notice today that a client whose application was submitted at the end of February was issued in Massachusetts. Massachusetts typically runs between 3 to 6 months. The reasons for this are two fold. They verify malpractice coverage for the past 10 years and the Massachusetts Medical Board does not like to communicate. Without regular communication the process cannot work smoothly. Because of this we have put into place a different procedure which is proven to be effective in moving the licenses through in a more expedited manner.</p>
